# Options for cookiecutter
The following options are available when using the cookiecutter:

1. __Full Name__: Will appear in the `pyproject.toml` file as the author. Will also be used as author of the documentation generated by [jupyter-book](https://scientificcomputing.github.io/reproducibility/part3/publishing.html).
2. __Email__: Will be used in `pyproject.toml` for package information.
3. __github\_username__: Will be used to fetch the correct links for the documentation and [license badge](https://scientificcomputing.github.io/reproducibility/part5/badges.html#licence).
4. __project\_name__: Used in various headers of the documentation
5. __repository\_name__: Name of the repository
6. __package\_name__: Name of the python package.
7. __project\_short\_description__: Usin in `pyproject.toml`
8. __version__: The initial version of the software.
9. __linting__: Enable linting, i.e. [mypy](https://scientificcomputing.github.io/reproducibility/part1/typing.html) and [flake8](https://scientificcomputing.github.io/reproducibility/part1/linting.html). This also enables the "Check Formatting" Github action.
10. __testing__: Choose testing framework. If not `none` it creates a test folder with an initial test. Also adds [optional installation dependencies](https://scientificcomputing.github.io/reproducibility/part1/packaging.html#optional-dependencies) to `pyproject.toml`. Creates a "Test Package" Github action. If `pytest-cov` is chosen, it adds settings to generate a coverage report and publsuh them as a [Github artifact](https://scientificcomputing.github.io/reproducibility/part1/coverage.html).
10. __use\_argparse__: Makes it possible to run the package as `module_name` or `python -m module_name` with inputs from the command line.
11. __build\_docs__: Build a webpage with documentation (including a package API).
12. __use_pre_commit__: Set up [pre-commit hooks](https://pre-commit.com) that will run some tests every time you make a commit.
13. __docker__: Adds a Dockerfile that includes the module (not including optional dependencies). Adds a [publishing workflow](https://scientificcomputing.github.io/reproducibility/part4/docker.html#github-packages).
14. __open\_source\_license__: Choose a open source license for your code
